NOTICE: Keep in mind that bugs that state simple usage disfunctionalities (i.e. message did not get sent) are more likely to be your fault for not using the Pusher properly.

After enabling debugging with SOKETI_DEBUG=1, make sure to read the console to see if the message is actually being sent to the server.
